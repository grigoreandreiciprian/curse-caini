            <p>Six greyhounds, attractive payout odds and pure live excitement – RACING DOGS was the first of our products to be launched and is still our most successful game to-date. Although your customers are betting on virtual dogs, thanks to over 5,000 real-life filmed racing sequences, they’ll experience real competitive fever just like being at the racetrack!</p>


            <p>The bettor’s experience is made even more realistic since the same race is shown everywhere at the same time – and you decide if a new race begins every one, two, three or four minutes. Real-time feeling, fair and long-lasting gaming excitement are guaranteed – also ensured by our certified odds generator, which prevents all manipulation.
                Additional winning chances add to all the excitement: throughout the day races are randomly tagged as Double-Win (x2) and Triple-Win (x3). Winnings in these races are doubled or even trebled. We can even set up a Bonus for you.</p>
